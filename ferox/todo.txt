Ferox shouldn't depend directly on the middleware bundle.
That or we should have a "core middleware" and then the other middleware.

Need some sort of high level exception handler that'll dispose of the tracked request objects...


Allow addition of ferox downstream handlers.
  -this'll allow other webfinger users (for example) to tack on additional links to an identity.
Allow builder type construction of full responses.

Fix splats so they can consume an arbitrary number of "/" segments.  This'll involve updating the node to know it is a multi-segment
 consuming node and to keep consuming segments while route matching continues to fail. 
 e.g.:
 1 consume piece,
 2 matach against wilds/regs/other guys
 3 if fail, goto 1
 4 return route
